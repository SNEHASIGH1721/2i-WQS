#WQS
#WQS regression model has been widely used in the 
#field of environmental epidemiology to address the impact of multiple environmental chemical exposure on certain outcome. WQS is established to address highly correlated and collinear data. We 
#utilized WQS regression to estimate joint associations of all five OPE 
#metabolites with CVD and calculated the empirical weight of each 
#element. Each weighted index represented the contribution of each OPE 
#metabolite substance included in the mixture to the positive association. 
#To begin with, concentrations of all OPE metabolites were ranked in 
#quartiles. Next, all data were randomly split into training set and validation set). The weighted index is constrained to a 
#range of 0â€“1, and to add up to 1 (Yu et al., 2022a). Based on previous 
#published studies, 1000 bootstrap replicates were performed to estimate 
#the magnitude of the effect and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 
#Data were randomly split into 60% validation set and 40% test set.
#researchers might be interested in taking into account the relationship between the exposures and the outcome while summarizing the complex exposure to the mixture of interest. The weighted quantile sum (WQS), developed specifically for the context of environmental mixtures analysis, is an increasingly common approach that allows evaluating a mixture-outcome association by 
#creating a summary score of the mixture in a supervised fashion
